History of the project
======================

This project was made as an obligatory project for PPK (Basics of Computer Programming) class
in the Silesian University of Technology. During the classes we had to pick one of fifteen different projects
and finish them before the end of the semester. Additionally we also had to write a documentation
for the project, which is why I write this in the first place. Thanks to that I finally got myself together
and expanded my previous build system by including an automated documentation generation.
