Compiling
---------

Install the dependencies and just compile it like any other cmake project:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make

.. note::
   If you have trouble compiling the project, please create a GitHub issue `here <https://github.com/michaelskyf/ppk-project-huffman/issues>`_

.. note::
   Executables will be present in the 'bin' subdirectory
